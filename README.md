# React Native Project with Firebase Authentication and Facebook Login

This project is a React Native app where I’ve integrated Facebook login using `react-native-fbsdk-next` and Firebase authentication. Below, I’ve documented all the steps I took to set up, configure, and run this project.

- [Configure Firebase for Android](#configure-firebase-for-android)
- [Setup Facebook Developer Account](#setup-facebook-developer-account)
- [Linking Firebase and Facebook](#linking-firebase-and-facebook)
- [Running the Project](#running-the-project)

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, I made sure to have the following:
- Node.js (https://nodejs.org/)
- React Native CLI (https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
- Android Studio (for Android emulation and development)
- A Firebase Project (https://firebase.google.com/)
- A Facebook Developer Account (https://developers.facebook.com/)

## Installation

1. First, I installed the react-naitve via this command:
    ```bash
    npx react-native@latest init
    ```

2. Then, I installed the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm i react-native-vector-icons
    ```

3. I also needed `react-native-fbsdk-next`, so I ran:
    ```bash
    npm install react-native-fbsdk-next
    ```

4. Since I’m using Firebase, I installed the necessary packages:
    ```bash
    npm install @react-native-firebase/app @react-native-firebase/auth
    ```

## Firebase Setup

1. I headed over to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and created a new project.
2. After that, I added an Android app under the project and registered it by providing the package name (e.g., `com.yourappname`).
3. Firebase then gave me a `google-services.json` file, which I placed in the `android/app/` directory of my project.

## Generate SHA-1 Key

To connect Firebase and Facebook correctly, I had to generate an SHA-1 key:

1. I opened the terminal, navigated to the Android directory of my project:
    ```bash
    cd android
    ```

2. Then I ran this command:
    ```bash
    ./gradlew signingReport
    ```

3. From there, I copied the SHA-1 key from the output.

4. Back in the Firebase Console, I added this SHA-1 key under the app settings.

## Configure Firebase for Android

To make sure everything worked smoothly with Firebase, I added the following:

1. In `android/build.gradle`, I added this line under `dependencies`:
    ```groovy
    buildscript {
        dependencies {
            classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.15' // Added this
        }
    }
    ```

2. In `android/app/build.gradle`, I added this line at the bottom:
    ```groovy
    apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
    ```

## Setup Facebook Developer Account

1. I created a Facebook developer account and then set up an app by heading over to the [Facebook Developer Console](https://developers.facebook.com/).
2. After that, I copied the `App ID` and `App Secret` from **Settings > Basic**.
3. I then went to **Add a Product** and selected **Facebook Login** to set up the Android platform.
4. In the **Facebook Login > Settings**, I needed to add **Key Hashes**. Here’s what I did:
    - I ran this command to generate the key hash:
      ```bash
      keytool -exportcert -alias androiddebugkey -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore | openssl sha1 -binary | openssl base64
      ```
    - The password is `android` (default for the debug keystore).
    - I copied the output key hash and pasted it into the **Key Hashes** field.

## Linking Firebase and Facebook

1. I went back to Firebase, navigated to **Authentication** > **Sign-in Method**, and enabled **Facebook** as a provider.
2. I then added the `App ID` and `App Secret` from the Facebook Developer Console.
3. Saved those changes, and the integration was complete.

## Running the Project

1. With everything set up, I made sure I had an Android emulator running or connected a physical device.
2. I started the project by running:
    ```bash
    npx react-native run-android
    ```

## Project Structure

- **App.js**: This is the main entry point that handles navigation.
- **pages/LoginScreen.js**: This screen includes Facebook and Google login options.
- **pages/Home.js**: This screen displays after a successful login.

## Miscellaneous
1. for seamless navigation between screens, i installed these dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm i @react-navigation/native
    npm i @react-navigation/stack
    npm i react-native-screens
    npm i react-native-safe-area-context
    ```
